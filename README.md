# My Conky setup

The base for this Conky setup was shamelessly stolen from [*Paanini*](http://www.flickr.com/photos/68483313@N05/).
You can thank him for that! :)

# How to install?

  * Install a Conky with LUA enabled (or compile it yourself)
  * Copy the contents of this repository into the `~/.conky/` folder
  * Configure your desktop to run the `~/.conky/start` shell script on startup (using `gnome-session-properties` for instance)

Done!
